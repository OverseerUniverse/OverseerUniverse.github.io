            Hi I'm Nathaniel Victorino, a 3rd year transfer student from Allan
            Hancock College! I grew up in Guadalupe with my mom and two sisters
            and 3 chihuahuas. I love playing video games like elden ring,
            roblox, <strong>call of duty</strong>, valorant, minecraft, ark, and
            a lot more. Outside of my dungeon, I enjoy going out to eat, going
            to the gym, skateboarding (occassionally because I always get
            injured) and also basketball.
          </p>

            When it comes to programming, I have made websites in the past for
            local businesses in Santa Maria like <em>lacafecita</em>. Here is a
            secret access code to an unfinished one lacafecita.com/secretaccess
            (dont actually make a purchase <strong>IT WILL CHARGE YOU</strong>)
            For this site I used Laravel as the backend with a React frontend! I
            also enjoy programming Roblox games if I have the spare time, I
            particularly want to build a sandbox game to play with friends.
